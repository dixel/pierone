   :target: https://travis-ci.org/zalando-stups/pierone
   :alt: Travis CI build status

.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/zalando-stups/pierone/badge.svg
   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/zalando-stups/pierone
   :alt: Coveralls status

Docker registry with immutable tags, repo permissions, S3 backend and OAuth.

Development
===========

The service is written in Clojure. You need Leiningen_ installed to build or develop.

To start a web server for the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein repl
    (go)

The web server will run on port 8080.

Testing
=======

Running unit tests with code coverage report:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein cloverage

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker pull busybox
    $ docker tag busybox localhost:8080/example/foobar:1.0
    $ docker push localhost:8080/example/foobar:1.0
    $ docker pull localhost:8080/example/foobar:1.0

Building
========

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein do uberjar, docker build

Running
=======

Pier One supports a number of environment variables to use the Amazon S3 backend.
You will need a PostgreSQL database (database schemas are created automatically on first start).

.. code-block:: bash

    # run Pier One locally with file backend and connect to localhost PostgreSQL
    # NOTE: we simply use the "host" networking hack here to connect to the localhost DB
    $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --net=host stups/pierone

``DB_SUBNAME``
    Postgres connection string, e.g "//pierone.foo.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/pierone?ssl=true". Default is "//localhost:5432/pierone"
``DB_PASSWORD``
    Postgres password. Default is "postgres".
``DB_USER``
    Postgres user name. Default is "postgres".
``HTTP_ALLOW_PUBLIC_READ``
    Allow Docker image downloads without authentication (e.g. to run Pier One as a registry for open source projects). Default is "false".
``HTTP_TEAM_SERVICE_URL``
    URL to get team membership information by user's UID.
``HTTP_TOKENINFO_URL``
    OAuth2 token info URL (e.g. https://example.org/oauth2/tokeninfo)
``PGSSLMODE``
    Set to "verify-full" in order to fully verify the Postgres SSL cert.
``STORAGE_S3_BUCKET``
    Only for S3 backend: the Amazon S3 bucket name.
